// An Environment is a list of frames.  Each frame represents a scope
// in the program and contains a set of name-value pairs.  The first
// frame in the environment represents the innermost scope.

// For the code below, I am assuming that a scope is implemented
// as an association list, i.e., a list of two-element lists.  E.g.,
// the association list ((x 1) (y 2)) associates the value 1 with x
// and the value 2 with y.

// To implement environments in an object-oriented style, it would
// be better to define a Frame class and make an Environment a list
// of such Frame objects.  If we simply use the parse tree structure
// for lists of association lists, we end up having to write the
// lookup functions in a more functional style.

// You need the following methods for modifying environments:
//  - constructors:
//      - create the empty environment (an environment with an empty frame)
//      - add an empty frame to the front of an existing environment
//  - lookup the value for a name (for implementing variable lookup)
//      if the name exists in the innermost scope, return the value
//      if it doesn't exist, look it up in the enclosing scope
//      if we don't find the name, it is an error
//  - define a name (for implementing define and parameter passing)
//      if the name already exists in the innermost scope, update the value
//      otherwise add a name-value pair as first element to the innermost scope
//  - assign to a name (for implementing set!)
//      if the name exists in the innermost scope, update the value
//      if it doesn't exist, perform the assignment in the enclosing scope
//      if we don't find the name, it is an error
