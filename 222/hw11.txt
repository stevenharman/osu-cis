1)a.	the while loops don't have to check |t|>0 b/c the character X is added at
	the very beginning, so you know that |t|>0.  There will be no violated 
	assertion where t is an empty string b/c t is no longer empty.

  b.	RFW_3, if t.Length() > 0 and there exists a separator in t[0] it is added 
	to the front of w (the if statement nested inside the nest else statement).

  c.	RFW_2, it checks to see if there is anything in t (t.Length() > 0) before 
	doing anything else and therefore not wasting as much time as the sentinel 
	version.

2)	object Stack_Of_Character temp;
   	object Character ch;

	while (self.Length() > 0)
	{
	  self.Pop(ch);
	  temp.Push(ch);
	}

	self &= temp;
