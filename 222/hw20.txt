function Hash(
	alters Text phone,
	produces Integer number
	)
{
	object Character ch;
	object Text t;
	
	while(phone.Length() > 0)
	{
		phone.Remove(0,ch);
		
		if(ch != '-')
		{
			t.Add(t.Length(), ch);
		}
	}
	number = To_Integer(t);
	return number;
}

2.A.
	If you were to use the same implementation for both 292-6446 and 292-OHIO you 
	would get two different integer values and so two different mappings to the phone
	number.
B.	
	For the hash function to handle this problem i would use a partial map that had each
	possible character (0-9 and A-Z) and the integer associated with that character on a
	phone (the integers 0-9).  Then you could use the partial map to find the integer you
	need.  So if the character was 'D', you would get the integer 3 back, the character 'T' 
	would return the integer 8, and the character '5' would return the integer 5.  In this way
	you would always have the correct integer for any phone number.
C.
	This case could be handled by simply adding to the partial map the characters a-z
	the integers associated with them.
