1. convention: if the sorting machine is in insertion phase then the heap is
empty.  If the sorting machine is NOT in insertion phase then the array has a lower 
bound of 1 and the heap has a size between 0 and the upper-bound of the array and all
elements of the array from 1 - the size of the heap are an ARE_IN_ORDER heap according
to the mapping from binary tree to array, and the queue is empty.

   correspondence: if the sorting machine is in inserting phase then all elements of
the machine are in the queue.  if the machine is not in inserting phase then for
any item x, x is in the machine if and only if it is in the array at some location 
between the lower bound and the size of the heap.
